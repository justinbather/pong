# Terminal Pong
Just for fun to see what's involved. First time building anything interactive like this.

Just one main file and about 600 lines of hacking. This is a local only implementation, with an "AI" player (just follows the balls y value).

This will be used to create a multiplayer version of this, in a suite, of terminal games.
